## ABSTRACT

A wiper speed control system for an automotive wiper controls the operational speed of a wiper in accordance with rain conditions. The control system includes a rain sensor detecting rain conditions to produce . an analog signal having an amplitude depending upon the detected rain conditions. The analog sensor signal is converted into a digital pulse signal by a converter for application to a digital circuit system. A control signal is produced by digitally processing the pulse signal. The control signal is applied to a wiper driver circuit to adjust the operational speed or timing in accordance with the control signal.

A wiper is a crucial part that eliminates precipitation or some other fluid from the windscreen of a vehicle. The past technique required manual wiper initiation, and raising the wiper was an extreme errand. Therefore, this framework is being introduced as an answer for these issues. The's task will likely stockpile cleaning frameworks for more established vehicles, work on the framework by utilizing actuators and pull switches (involving similar switch for different capacities by stepwise exchanging), and oversee motor and wiper speed with a solitary switch. This System manages the wiper's activity speed in light of how much downpour. This Wiper Speed Control System is used in a wide range of cars, and its essential capacity is to eliminate downpour air drops from the vehicle's front screen.
